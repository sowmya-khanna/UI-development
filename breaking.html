        <h1>robin hood: castle rescure</h1>
        <p>
            robin hood whistled as he stirred a pot of soup. the hero was hidden deep in sherwood forest. his job had become very hard lately. 
            prince john and the sheriff were trying their best of capture him.
            luckily, robin hood had good friends on his side. little john, friar tuck, and maid marian were all helping him come up with plans
            to help the people of nottingham.
            "don't burn the soup, rob!" little john called as he and maid marian arrived with wood for the fire.
            "i'll only make that mistake once", robin hood answered, handing out soup to his friends. robin was about to a sip when friar tuck
            appeared! the friar was out of breath and looked very wooried.
