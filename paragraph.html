            The day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the beginning of the United States Christmas shopping season 
            since 1952. The practice may be linked with the idea of Santa clause parades. Parades celebrating Thanksgiving 
            often include an appearance by Santa at the end of the parade, with the idea that "Santa has arrived" 
            or "Santa is just around the corner" because Christmas is always the next major Christian holiday following 
            thanksgiving.
