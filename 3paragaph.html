            <h1>robin hood: castle rescure</h1>
            <p>robin hood whistled as he stirred a pot of soup. the hero was hidden deep in sherwood forest. his job had become very hard lately. 
            prince john and the sheriff were trying their best of capture him.</p>
            <p>luckily, robin hood had good friends on his side. little john, friar tuck, and maid marian were all helping him come up with plans
            to help the people of nottingham.</p>
            <p>"don't burn the soup, rob!" little john called as he and maid marian arrived with wood for the fire.</p>
            <p>"i'll only make that mistake once", robin hood answered, handing out soup to his friends. robin was about to a sip when friar tuck
            appeared! the friar was out of breath and looked very wooried.</p>
